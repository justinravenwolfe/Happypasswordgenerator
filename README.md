First validating password by using prompts and alerts

Create array of upper case letters
Create array of lower case letters
Create array of numbers
create array of symbols
Loading in an HTML elemenent so an action can be attatched to it
create function to validate password length
Check for whether the password has incorrect length
Lay out the requirements for passwords
Add uppercase characters as a possibility for generating password
Add lowercase characters as a possibility for generating password
Add uppercase numbers as a possibility for generating password
Add symbols characters as a possibility for generating password
add parameters

Second Create for loop

 <!-- Instead of sendingn in separate list of different typess of characters, numbers, symbols, etc.  Send  in the password options list already preloaded with the correct characters along with the length of the password.  Then simplified the logic of password generate to just use for loop and math.random to pick that number of random character to build to password. -->

Use math floor to pick random index in the list
Set the symbol variable equal to the character at that index
Write password to the #password input
Generate the password
Going back to HTML and outputting password onto screen
Add event listener to generate button
